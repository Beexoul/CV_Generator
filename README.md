**CV Generator**

## Introduction

This script is a simple CV (Curriculum Vitae) generator that allows you to create a PDF version of your CV by providing your personal information, educational qualifications, work experience, skills, projects, certifications, publications, awards, and interests. It uses the ReportLab library to generate the PDF.
